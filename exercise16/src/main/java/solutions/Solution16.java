/*
Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare it to the legal driving age of sixteen. If the user is
sixteen or older, then the program should display "You are old enough to legally drive." If the user is under sixteen,
the program should display "You are not old enough to legally drive."
    Use a single output statement.
    Use a ternary operator to write this program. If your language doesnâ€™t support a ternary operator, use a regular
    if/else statement, and still use a single output statement to display the message.

    1. Prompt user for their age
    2. Use ternary operator to set string to "You are old enough to legally drive."/"You are not old enough to legally
    drive." if age is >= or < 16.
    3. Output string
